# 1. Theoretical exercise



# 2. Practical exercise


# Deliverables

 Use the template to hand-in your assignment that should include your answers to both the theoretical and practical questions. If using Quarto, use the `report.qmd` file to write your report [^1]. Alternatively, any other format that produces a pdf file is fine (e.g., Rmarkdown), as long as the code is well commented and made available too.

[^1]: `.qmd` files are [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) files, which can be used to write markdown report with R, Julia, and Python (sometimes simultaneously).
